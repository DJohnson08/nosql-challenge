The two Files we used were analysis and construcing of code with noSQL. 

File 1: NoSQL_analysis_starter

First Steps:
Initialization of a MongoClient to connect to a MongoDB instance running on the default port (27017).
Assignment of the uk_food database to a variable, suggesting the database was pre-populated with data for analysis.
Further analysis steps (not fully reviewed yet) are likely built around querying the database and converting results to Pandas DataFrames.
Markdown Cells: Provides high-level guidance for exploratory analysis. It specifies the use of count_documents to count documents, pprint to display results, and Pandas to process data.
Strengths: Clear instructions for exploratory analysis.
Logical structure for connecting to the database and performing analysis.
Potential Improvements: Ensure all code is well-documented for clarity, especially for users unfamiliar with MongoDB.
Include examples or placeholders for specific queries to guide the user further.


File 2: NoSQL_setup_starter

Code Cells: Basic setup includes creating a MongoDB client and confirming the database's existence.
Likely acts as a starting point for configuring the database before analysis.
Markdown Cells: Provides detailed instructions for importing data from a JSON file (establishments.json) into MongoDB.
Encourages users to document their terminal commands for future reproducibility.
Strengths: Good emphasis on reproducibility by requesting terminal commands to be logged.
Straightforward MongoDB connection setup.
Potential Improvements: Include examples of validation steps to ensure the data was imported correctly (e.g., checking document counts or schema validation).
Provide troubleshooting tips for common issues during data import.
General Feedback: Both notebooks are logically structured and provide a good framework for setting up and analyzing data in a MongoDB database. However, there are opportunities to make the notebooks more user-friendly and comprehensive:

Documentation: Add inline comments to clarify each step for beginners.
Error Handling: Introduce basic error-handling techniques (e.g., try-except blocks) for MongoDB operations.
Guided Examples: Add detailed examples for queries and analysis to make the notebooks self-contained.
Validation: Include steps to validate data after import and query results during analysis.
